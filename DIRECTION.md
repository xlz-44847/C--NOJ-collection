# C--NOJ-collection

Direction:  This repository is used for saving the process of practicing. These tests come from the assignments of my homework. While I try to solve these questions ,I often get some ideas or pick up something that I did not notice before. Therefore , creating a repository to record my thought and some better solutions is necessary.

Will update continually... (NWPU)
